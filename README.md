Project Overview

CELESTIA is a unified, AI-powered exoplanet detection platform designed to rapidly and accurately identify exoplanet candidates from multiple survey datasets including Kepler, K2, and TESS. By combining ensemble machine learning (XGBoost + Deep Learning hybrid) with advanced feature engineering rooted in astrophysical principles, ExoDiscover achieves 99%+ classification accuracy offline, enabling astronomers, students, and citizen scientists to explore and analyze planetary systems without expensive infrastructure.
It is designed for accessibility, scalability, and real-time interactive visualization, making it both a research and educational tool.

Key Features
- Rapid Exoplanet Detection & Classification
Identifies Planetary Candidates (PC), False Positives (FP), and Known Planets (KP) in real time.

- Cross-Survey Integration
Combines data from Kepler, K2, and TESS for a unified analysis pipeline.

- Advanced Feature Analytics
Computes radius, mass, eccentricity, orbital period, transit depth, and duration for stellar and planetary systems.

- Interactive Visualization
Real-time orbital simulations, transit light curves, and feature visualizations.

- Offline Operation
Works without cloud computing — fully functional on a local machine.

- Ensemble AI Model
Uses XGBoost + Deep Learning hybrid for high-accuracy classification.

- Export & Reporting
Generates CSV, JSON, and visualization-ready outputs for downstream research.

- Educational & Citizen Science Ready
Accessible to students and enthusiasts with interactive tutorials and visual feedback.

- Future-Ready Architecture
Scalable for upcoming missions like PLATO and JWST follow-ups.

Problem Statement
The universe contains millions of stars, but only a fraction of exoplanets have been discovered. Traditional methods of detection are computationally intensive, require multiple telescopes, and often miss faint signals.

One-liner Problem:
"Exoplanet detection is slow, incomplete, and inaccessible to many researchers and enthusiasts worldwide."

Solution Overview
ExoDiscover solves this by:
- Ingesting Kepler, K2, and TESS survey data.
- Applying feature engineering based on astrophysical laws to extract meaningful patterns.
- Running a hybrid ML ensemble (XGBoost + Deep Learning) for ultra-accurate exoplanet classification.
- Visualizing orbital parameters, transit events, and planetary analytics in real time.
- Exporting findings in researcher-friendly formats while remaining fully offline.

USP / Standout Points:
- Works offline without cloud dependency.
- Integrates cross-survey datasets in a single platform.
- Provides real-time interactive visualization for research and education.
- Achieves >98% accuracy using hybrid ML models.
- Empowers citizen scientists and educators for hands-on learning.
 
How It Works
Pipeline Flow:
Data Ingestion 
Load and standardize survey datasets (Kepler, K2, TESS).

Feature Engineering
Extract astrophysical features: transit depth, duration, orbital period, eccentricity, stellar mass/radius.

ML Model Training
Train XGBoost on labeled datasets (PC, FP, KP).
Use Deep Learning (optional hybrid) to refine predictions.

Prediction & Classification
Classify exoplanet candidates with confidence scores.

Visualization & Analysis
Generate orbital simulations, light curve plots, and feature dashboards.

Export & Reporting
Save outputs as CSV, JSON, or images for publications or further research.
